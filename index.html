        <H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>


        <p>Kate Chopin was born in St. Louis in 1851. Her parents, Thomas and Eliza O'Flaherty, were wealthy, slave-owning Catholics who held a prominent position in their community. When Chopin was four, her father died in a train accident, and she was raised by her French-Creole mother and great-grandmother. At seventeen, she graduated from the Academy of the Sacred Heart. Two years later, in 1870, she married Oscar Chopin, a Louisiana businessman of French-Creole descent. In New Orleans, where she and her husband lived until 1879, Chopin was at the centre of Southern aristocratic social life. During this period, she bore six children. In 1879, when Oscar's business failed, the family moved to Coulterville, where Oscar's family owned a farm and a plantation store. When Oscar died in 1882, Chopin was left with six children and meagre financial resources. The family moved back to St. Louis in 1884.</p>
        <P>Although Kate Chopin is regarded as an important writer today, her reputation has not always been so strong. Known primarily as a Southern regionalist writer, or "local colorist" during her lifetime, Chopin's stories and novels shocked many of her nineteenth-century readers. In the 1960s, with the rise of the feminist movement, critics rediscovered Chopin. "The Story of an Hour," first published in 1894 in Voguemagazine, is one of Chopin's briefest and most widely read stories. Louise Mallard's response to the news that her husband has been killed and her demise upon his appearance, exemplifies Chopin's beliefs regarding women's roles in marriage and feminine identity. The story was initially rejected by Century magazine, and by Vogue as well, and it was published only after Chopin's collection Bayou Folk garnered critical acclaim.</P>

        <P>In the light of second wave of feminist movement, “The Feminine Mystique”, a landmark book by feminist Betty Friedan published in 1963 that described the pervasive dissatisfaction among women in conventional American society in the post-World War II period. She coined the term feminine mystique to describe the societal assumption that women could find fulfilment through housework, marriage, sexual passivity, and child nurture alone. Further, prevailing attitudes held that “truly feminine” women had no desire for higher education, careers, or a political voice; rather, they found complete fulfilment in the domestic sphere. Friedan, however, noted that many housewives were unsatisfied with their lives but had difficulty articulating their feelings. Friedan deemed that unhappiness and inability to live up to the feminine mystique the “problem that has no name.” This study explores Friedan’s notion of “Feminine mystique” in The Story of an Hour by Kate Chopin.</P>
        <H3>Statement of the Problem</H3>
        <p>Kate Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour”, is considered to be a feminist writing. During that period in American Societies, it was thought that women could find fulfilment through housework, marriage, sexual passivity, and child nurture alone. Further, dominant belief held that “truly feminine” women had no desire for higher education, careers, or a political voice; rather, they found complete fulfilment in the domestic sphere. So, in this study I want to explore that to which extent women are satisfied and happy with their married life in “The Story of an Hour”.</p>

        <H3>Research Objective</H3>
        <P>To analyse the role of marriage in the story of an hour.</P>

        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <p>The Research question of the study is;</p>
        <P>•  What is the role of marriage in The Story of an Hour?</P>
        <H3>Significance of the Study</H3>
        <P> This study is significant in a way that it explores role of marriages in the 18th century American novel. Many of the feminist works address the suppression of women in texts through different lens but this study explores that how marriage was used to suppress women. </P>
        <H3>Delimitation</H3>
        <P>Since, we know that there are many techniques within feminist analysis to see any text. This study is delimited to the feminine mystique in “The Story of an Hour” by Kate Chopin. This study analysis the text through the role of marriage. It explores the cause and effects of marriage on life of women in the story.

        <h3><u>CHAPTER 2</u></h3>
        <h3>LITERATURE REVIEW</h3>
        <p>Betty Friedan played a significant part in sparking the second-wave of feminism in the United States. Friedan authored The Feminine Mystique, which publicized women’s passive behaviour and indifferent livelihood. In her novel, Friedan highlighted society’s biased treatment against women based on their controlled living condition as a housewife. Friedan argued women’s growth potential had been restricted due to women’s glorification of family, loss of identity, lack of education, and misinterpretation of their gender role. Friedan conducted interviews and detailed women’s actions to support her assertion. Friedan argued the central catalyst towards women’s restriction in personal development rests on their glorification of the housewife role in the family. Women knew what they wanted to be and 
        what they were going to be at a very young age. In fact, the common little girl’s dream was to get married, have four children, and live in a house in a nice suburb.1 Friedan concluded young women had an unhealthy obsession with finding a husband in order to accomplish their objective of raising a family. This can be reflected when women would take accounting classes, attend sports lessons, and join churches just to find a potential companion.</p>
        <p>Selina jamil (2009) explored that Chopin demonstrates that how powerful is emotion that it enables clarity of perception in Louise. It allows her to perceive life’s immeasurable beauty, without which, as she realizes with the suddenness of acutely shocking pain at the sudden entry of her husband, there is only death: the “joy” that kills Louise is the joy that (unbeknownst to the doctors who ironically assume that it is joy at her husband’s return that kills her, she refuses to surrender, as the patriarchy would require her to do at Brently’s return. But, for one climactic hour of her life, Louise does truly taste joy. For one hour of emotion, Louise does glimpse meaning and fulfilment. To be fully alive, then, is to engage in heightened consciousness, to observe and connect with the world around one’s self. Indeed, Chopin makes clear that to simply observe the world through one’s rational faculty is nowhere near as powerful as observing it with the vibrant, vigorous, acute, and heightened awareness.</p>

        <p>awareness.
  Wang found out that, Chopin clearly suggests that any woman seeking for ideal feminine selfhood and freedom is innocent, naïve and idealistic in a hostile patriarchal society that certainly does not allow any feminine self-assertion for the time being. Thus, the fate of Louise’s selfhood and freedom is bound to be doomed. Like the tragic death of Edna Pontellier at the end of The Awakening, Louise’s death reveals the impossibility of an idealistic feminist searching for selfhood and freedom at a wrong time. By the death of Louise at the end of the story, Chopin clearly implies that any woman’s search for ideal feminine selfhood is impossible in an age dominated by powerful patriarchs, but by Louise’s search for selfhood and feminine emancipation, with a prophetic vision and foresight, Chopin obviously shows that hopeful feminine selfhood and freedom are possible in a new era to come.

But there is no evident of exploring the story through the notion of “The feminine Mystique”. This study explores the notion of feminine mystique and analysis the role marriage in women life.

<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
<br>
<br>
    <p>The theoretical framework of this study is drawn from Betty Frieden’s notion of “The Feminine Mystique”. Study is qualitative in nature and textual analysis of the text is conducted through reading and thinking. Reading is a thinking process. Rosenblatt (1995) states that there is a conforming connection between the reader and the text. Rosenblatt (1991) argues that the significance the reader makes from the text is synthesized with the text and the life setting the reader brings to text.</p>
        <br>






        <p>Kate Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour” (1894) is analysed in the light of Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine Mystique”. The story is also the sample of the study.</p>

       <h3><U>CHAPTER 4 </U>

</h3><H3>ANALYSIS</H3>

        <p>The Story of an Hour by Kate Chopin provides a solid explanation of the feminine role in American society during the late 1800s. Women of that time were expected to get married and frequently they were married to older men. It is suggested in this story that her husband, Brently Mallard, was older than her.</p>
        <P> “she was young with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength”</P>
        <P>“she knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked saved with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead.” </P>     
        <P>Chopin describes Mrs. Mallard as young but aged by her repression which is telling of this period when men frequently held the power. The story does not lead the reader to believe that Mrs. Mallard was in love with her husband, rather, as with many marriages during that time, it was probably an economic and social arrangement. In American family class, during this time couples wed because they made a good economic and social team rather than their romantic compatibility with each other. Couples were rarely in love prior to their engagement instead they “learned to love each other.” It seems because of external social pressures that Mrs. Mallard is for the first time realizing the world outside the life she has previously known. I do not think prior to her husband’s “death” that she even fully realized her unhappiness with life. </P>
        <P>“…men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.” </P>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>This statement makes it seem that Mrs. Mallard had previously made excuses for her husband’s behaviour perhaps for her own sake, so she did not have to face her dissatisfaction with her marriage. She seems generally disinterested in the institution of marriage regardless of if her husband was a good or bad man. Being widowed was one of the only ways to escape society’s expectation of marriage at that time. </p>
        <P>“She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.” </P>
        <P>Freed from a marriage that she was not enthusiastic about she becomes excited about the possibilities life has to offer her. This may be the first time she has viewed herself as an individual rather than part of a marriage</P>

        <H3>Conclusion</H3>
        <p>The analysis of “The Story of an Hour” revealed that it was a social construct in American societies that women finds happiness and love in marriages. The term coined for this by Betty Friedan “The Feminine Mystique”, which gave sense in the story that it was mere suppression of women. Mrs. Mallard was never happy with her marriage or husband. She struggled being with her husband and felt a sense of freedom when heard about the death of Brently Mallard. Hence, the role of marriage to comfort women is compromised in the analysed story. There is possibility of other revelations if the story is analysed using a different framework such as Marxist feminism can be very helpful for the exploration of other reasons and ways of suppression of women in the novels.</p>
